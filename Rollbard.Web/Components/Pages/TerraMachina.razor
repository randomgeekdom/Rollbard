            <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
            <p>Over the course of millennia, what began as a world of fantasy and myth advances beyond its ages of primitivity, agriculture, conquest, exploration, and industry. It is now an age of technology. Life transpires on the spectrum of science and sorcery. It is a world where the gods of the machine coexist with the gods of the natural world. Welcome to Terra Machina.</p>
            <br />

            <p>
                Terra Machina is a tabletop RPG based that takes inspiration from Japanese roleplaying video games of the late 1990s. It imagines a fantasy world where time has passed to the point where technology is just as powerful as magic. It is meant to be a unique experience that combines the best elements of fantasy, science fiction, and action.
